I decided to use activity as a supertype and differentiate between a project and a class using the ACTIVITY_TYPE field. Both Class and Project will share the attributes of ACTIVITY table. I was not able to find the symbol for complete constraint(Total completeness) for the category symbol or would have included in the diagram. The professor can have a M:N relationship with the class but a 1:M with Projects. I split the survey results into 2 tables; one for the activity encompassing class and project survey results and professor survey results.

# CSCI-585-Database-Systems
Database system architecture; conceptual database models; semantic, object-oriented, logic-based, and relational databases; user and program interfaces; database system implementation; integrity, security, concurrency and recovery.

Homework 1: Create a conceptual Entity-Relational (ER) diagram, to model the scenario.

Homework 2: Using Docker, create a mysql server and run SQL commands to create tables and fill them with sample data based on the ERD diagram from HW1.

Homework 3: Working with geospatial data (adding longitude and latitude to data points) collect, store, query/process and visualize spatial data.
- You'll be using the KML file format, shapefile format (.shp) Google Earth, Postgres+PostGIS, ArcGIS, JavaScript, R. spatial data, use of spatial file formats and spatial query functions.
- Use of JavaScript and R libraries for plotting map coords, generating spatial data via calculation
- Compute the convex hull for your 13 points [a for a set of 2D points is the smallest convex polygon that contains the point set].
- Compute the nearest neighbor of your home/apt/dormroom location.

Homework 4: Data mining using UI-based tools WEKA, KNIME, RapidMiner. Build linear regression model to find summary statistics.

Homework 5: Working with NoSQL (using data stored in JSON format). Usued MongoDB Atlas - a cloud-based installation of MongoDB. Used GeoJSON library to perform geospatial functions similar to HW3.
